# Data Structures

#### What are data structures?
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

- Linear Data Structure: A data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
    - Static Data Structure: A static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
        An example of this data structure is an array.
    - Dynamic Data Structure: In a dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during runtime, which can be considered efficient in relation to the memory (space) complexity of the code.
        Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

#### Stack
#### LinkedList


- Non-linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we cannot traverse all the elements in just one run.
    Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.
